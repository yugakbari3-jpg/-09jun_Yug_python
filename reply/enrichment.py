2. TIME RANGE: If mentioned, convert to exact timestamps

Rules:
- keywords: content topics only (no time words like "yesterday", "today"). Include both specific terms and general category tags when applicable (e.g., for recipes or meal prep you could include "cooking" and "nutrition").
- prefer concise noun phrases; lowercase; no punctuation; deduplicate similar terms
- questions: short personal questions about the user that this query implies. Omit for factual/utility queries (time, maths, definitions) that need no personal context. Also omit any question whose answer is already present in the ALREADY IN CONTEXT block (e.g. do not ask "where is the user located?" when a location is shown there, and do not ask about topics the user just mentioned in the recent dialogue).
- from/to: only if time mentioned, convert to exact UTC timestamps

    "Relevance is judged against the query: a snippet that is substantive "
    "but OFF-TOPIC for the current query must be omitted. Preserve user "
    "preferences, decisions, and substantive information from the snippets "
    "that are on-topic. Stay faithful to what the snippets say, and "
    "preserve attribution (who said what):\n"
    "- If nothing in the snippets is relevant to the current query, reply "
    "with the single word: NONE\n"
    "- RECOMMENDATION / OPINION / 'WHAT SHOULD I' queries (e.g. 'what should "
    "I watch tonight', 'suggest a restaurant', 'what book should I read', "
    "'give me a recipe idea', 'any news I'd like') are preference-sensitive. "

    "preference signals even when no explicit preference was stated — "
    "engagement is itself a signal, so do NOT return NONE just because the "

    "user has recently engaged with (films they asked about, dishes they "
    "cooked, artists they listened to, topics they read about) plus any "
    "reactions they expressed. Also flag items they have already "

    "paraphrase of what a snippet literally says.\n"
    "- You may add NOTHING beyond what the snippets contain — no year, "

    "up fresh; your job is to relay memory, not to extend it.\n"
    "- PRESERVE ATTRIBUTION. If a snippet says \"the assistant said X is "
    "Y\", keep the \"the assistant said\" wrapper in your note — do not "
    "strip it and restate X is Y as a plain fact. An attributed assistant "
    "claim is a historical record of a past answer, not an established "
    "fact, and the main assistant must be able to see the attribution so "
    "it knows to re-verify with tools rather than trust-by-default.\n"
    "- User-stated facts (preferences, biography, decisions, plans) can "
    "be relayed as plain user facts without an attribution wrapper — "
    "those are authoritative for the user's own data.\n"
    "- Tool-grounded information (weather, calculator results, etc.) in "
    "the snippets can be relayed without wrapper too.\n"
    "- If a snippet shows a user correcting an assistant claim, relay "
    "BOTH: the claim and the correction. Do not collapse into just the "
    "final value.\n"
    "- Do NOT fabricate dates or numbers. Copy from the snippets or omit.\n"

    "is or what you know about them (\"what do you know about me\", "
    "\"tell me about myself\", \"what are my interests\"), include "
    "ONLY user-stated facts about the user — location, interests, "
    "preferences, ongoing plans, biography. When several such facts "
    "are present, surface them together within the 2-3 sentence "
    "budget rather than picking just one. EXCLUDE topics the user "
    "merely asked about in the past: omit them entirely, do not "
    "narrate them, do not add clauses like \"the user also asked "
    "about X\". A past Q&A about a maths problem, a geography "
    "question, a currency conversion, or a film title is NOT a fact "
    "about the user unless the snippet says the user is into that "
    "topic. If no user-stated facts are present, reply NONE.\n"
